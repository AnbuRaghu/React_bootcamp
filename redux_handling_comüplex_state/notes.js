/** if we have multiple part of state, we have to manually update the other parts of state too even if they are not concerning to us in this case our other part of states are count and favouritethings... what i mean is when we add things to our favourite things, we can't simply return an object to our favourite things and expect our count will stick around..so when I'm adding a favourite thing i want to make sure that all the other part of state i'm keeping like this ...state spreading the state,whatever state i want to uodate i need to make sure i keep all the other part of state
